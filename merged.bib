  ABSTRACT = {Shared-memory multiprocessors commonly use shared variables for synchronization. Our simulations of real parallel applications show that large-scale cache-coherent multiprocessors suffer significant amounts of invalidation traffic due to synchronization. Large multiprocessors that do not cache synchronization variables are often more severely impacted. If this synchronization traffic is not reduced or managed adequately, synchronization references can cause severe congestion in the network. We propose a class of adaptive back-off methods that do not use any extra hardware and can significantly reduce the memory traffic to synchronization variables. These methods use synchronization state to reduce polling of synchronization variables. Our simulations show that when the number of processors participating in a barrier synchronization is small compared to the time of arrival of the processors, reductions of 20 percent to over 95 percent in synchronization traffic can be achieved at no extra cost. In other situations adaptive backoff techniques result in a tradeoff between reduced network accesses and increased processor idle time.},

  ABSTRACT = {We provide tight upper and lower bounds, up to a constant factor, for the number of inputs and outputs~(I/Os) between internal memory and secondary storage required for five sorting-related problems: sorting, the fast Fourier transform (FFT), permutation networks, permuting, and matrix transposition. The bounds hold both in the worst case and in the average case, and in several situations the constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a magnetic disk capable of transfering $P$~blocks each containing $B$~records in a single time unit; the records in each block must be input from or output to $B$~contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for $P=1$ that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in the number of~I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same number of~I/Os as does the permutation phase of key sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is not faster. We also give a simpler and more direct derivation of Hong and Kung's lower bound for the FFT for the special case $B = P = O(1)$.},

  COMMENT = {Good comments on typical external sorts, and how big they are. Focuses on parallelism at the disk. They give tight theoretical bounds on the number of I/O's required to do external sorting and other problems (FFTs, matrix transpose, etc.). If $x$ is the number of blocks in the file and $y$ is the number of blocks that fit in memory, then the number of I/Os needed grows as $\Theta (x \log x / \log y)$. If parallel transfers of $p$ blocks are allowed, speedup linear in $p$ is obtained.},

  ABSTRACT = {In practice, almost all dynamic systems require decisions to be made on-line, without full knowledge of their future impact on the system. A general model for the processing of sequences of tasks is introduced, and a general on-line decision algorithm is developed. It is shown that, for an important class of special cases, this algorithm is optimal among all on-line algorithms.\par Specifically, a task system $(S,d)$ for processing sequences of tasks consists of a set $S$ of states and a cost matrix $d$ where $d(i, j)$ is the cost of changing from state $i$ to state $j$ (we assume that $d$ satisfies the triangle inequality and all diagonal entries are 0). The cost of processing a given task depends on the state of the system. A schedule for a sequence $T^{1}, T^{2},\ldots{}, T^{k}$ of tasks is a sequence $s_{1}, s_{2},\ldots{}, s_{k}$ of states where $s_{i}$ is the state in which $T^{i}$ is processed; the cost of a schedule is the sum of all task processing costs and the state transition costs incurred.\par An on-line scheduling algorithm is one that chooses $s_{i}$ only knowing $T^{1}, T^{2}, \ldots{}, T^{i}$. Such an algorithm is $w$-competitive if, on any input task sequence, its cost is within an additive constant of $w$ times the optimal offline schedule cost. The competitive ratio $w(S, d)$ is the infimum $w$ for which there is a $w$-competitive on-line scheduling algorithm for $(S,d)$. It is shown that $w(S, d) = 2|S|-1$ {\em for every task system\/} in which $d$ is symmetric, and $w(S, d) = O(|S|^{2})$ for every task system. Finally, randomized on-line scheduling algorithms are introduced. It is shown that for the uniform task system (in which $d(i,j) = 1$ for all $i,j$), the expected competitive ratio $\bar{w}(S,d) = O(\log|S|)$.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is shown that arithmetic expressions with n greater than equivalent to 1 variables and constants; operations of addition, multiplication, and division; and any depth of parenthesis nesting can be evaluated in time 4 log//2n plus 10(n minus 1)/p using p greater than equivalent to 1 processors which can independently perform arithmetic operations in unit time. This bound is within a constant factor of the best possible. A sharper result is given for expressions without the division operation, and the question of numerical stability is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a version of cache oblivious search trees which is simpler than the previous proposal of Bender, Demaine and Farach-Colton and has the same complexity bounds. In particular, our data structure avoids the use of weight balanced B-trees, and can be implemented as just a single array of data elements, without the use of pointers. The structure also improves space utilization. \par For storing n elements, our proposal uses $(1+\epsilon) n$ times the element size of memory, and performs searches in worst case $O(log_B n)$ memory transfers, updates in amortized $O((log_2 n)/(\epsilon B))$ memory transfers, and range queries in worst case $O(\log_B n + k/B)$ memory transfers, where $k$ is the size of the output. \par The basic idea of our data structure is to maintain a dynamic binary tree of height $\log n+O(1)$ using existing methods, embed this tree in a static binary tree, which in turn is embedded in an array in a cache oblivious fashion, using the van Emde Boas layout of Prokop. \par We also investigate the practicality of cache obliviousness in the area of search trees, by providing an empirical comparison of different methods for laying out a search tree in memory.},

The result is a user space virtual machine using simulated hardware constructed from services provided by the host kernel. A Linux virtual machine is capable of running nearly all of the applications and services available on the host architecture. This paper describes the capabilities of a user-mode virtual machine, the design and implementation of the port, some of the applications that it lends itself to, and some of the work that remains to be done.},

  ABSTRACT = {A growing imbalance in CPU (central processing unit) and I/O (input/output) speeds has led to a communications bottleneck in distributed architectures, especially for data intensive applications such as multimedia information systems, databases, and grand challenge problems. Our solution is to schedule parallel I/O operations explicitly. We present a class of decentralized scheduling algorithms that eliminate contention for I/O ports while maintaining an efficient use of bandwidth. These algorithms based on edge coloring and matching of bipartite graphs, rely upon simple heuristics to obtain shorter schedules. We use simulation to evaluate the ability of our algorithms to obtain near optimal solutions in a distributed context, and compare our work with that of other researchers. Our results show that our algorithms produce schedules within 5% of the optimal schedule, a substantial improvement over existing algorithms. (20 refs.)},

@ARTICLE{Franklin79,
  ABSTRACT = {[from the introduction] An important problem in database processing is the manipulation of a set of $N$ records with keys chosen from a key space of cardinality much greater than $N$. This means that a bit map of the set is infeasible. Some typical operations include the following: (1) finding the record with a given key, if it exists; (2) finding the record with the next higher (or lower) key than a given record, whose location we may or may not already know; (3) finding all the records with keys in a certain range; (4) adding a record to the set and (5) deleting a record from the set. \par This paper presents a new data structure, the padded list, that does all the above operations in expected time $T=\theta(\log\text{}\log N)$ if the record keys are drawn independently from a known probability distribution. However, if the keys are selected by an adversary, the worst case time for padded lists, like hash tables, is $T=\theta(N)$.},

  ABSTRACT = {{Stochastic substitution, the Gibbs sampler, and the sampling-importance-resampling algorithm can be viewed as three alternative sampling- (or Monte Carlo-) based approaches to the calculation of numerical estimates of marginal probability distributions. The three approaches will be reviewed, compared, and contrasted in relation to various joint probability structures frequently encountered in applications. In particular, the relevance of the approaches to calculating Bayesian posterior densities for a variety of structured models will be discussed and illustrated.}},

  SUMMARY = {Three reasons to use non-blocking synchronization in the Cache Kernel: 1) synchronous code can be executed in asynchronous signal handlers, as in OORPC; 2) minimizes interference between process scheduling and synchronization; 3) non-blocking synchronization provides greater insulation from failures. Three synergies: 1) (asynchronous) signals are only kernel-supported notification; 2) tolerance of threads being terminated (fail-stopped) in the middle of ``system library'' code, such as handling a page fault, etc; 3) isolation of synchronization from scheduling and thread deletion allows modular and reliable system design. Implementation uses: atomic DCAS, type-stable memory management, and contention-minimizing data structures.},

Obstruction-freedom only guarantees progress in the absence of conflicts; thus some external contention-reducing method (such as exponential backoff) must be utilized to guarantee progress for the system as a whole.

@ARTICLE{HofriKo87,
  ABSTRACT = {We study a data structure $\bold L$ referred to variously as a padded list, a controlled density array or a sparse table, containing records $\{R\sb i\}$ each uniquely identified by a key $\{k(R\sb i)\}$. The data structure $\bold L$ is required to support the operations $\roman{Search}(\bold L, k)$, $\roman{Insert}(\bold L, k)$ and $\roman{Delete}(\bold L, k)$ to search, insert and delete a record with key $k$. To optimize $\roman{Search}(\bold L, k)$, records are stored with their keys in sorted order. If the order of the keys is to be maintained under insertion, records currently in $\bold L$ must be moved to free space. To improve the efficiency of $\roman{Insert}(\bold L, k)$, records are stored in a circular buffer with `gaps' so that insertion necessitates moving only records up to the next gap. The array is expanded and contracted during a sequence of insertions and deletions depending upon the current number of gaps. In this paper we assess the amount of work required to insert a sequence of records.},

  ABSTRACT = {We prove that the {\em work function algorithm\/} for the $k$-server problem has a competitive ratio at most 2$k$-1. Manasse et al. [1988] conjectured that the competitive ratio for the $k$-server problem is exactly $k$ (it is trivially at least $k$); previously the best-known upper bound was exponential in $k$. Our proof involves three crucial ingredients: A {\em quasiconvexity property\/} of work functions, a {\em duality lemma\/} that uses quasiconvexity to characterize the configuration that achieve maximum increase of the work function, and a {\em potential function\/} that exploits the duality lemma.},

  SUMMARY = {ARGUS programming language and system. ``Our approach is to provide atomicity as a fundamental concept in the language.'' ``The main features are guardians, the logical unit of distribution in our system, and atomic actions.'' ``Our implementation of (mutable) built-in atomic objects is based on a fairly simple locking model. There are two kinds of locks: read locks and write locks.'' Nested actions: ``To keep the locking rules simple, we do not allow a parent action to run concurrently with its children.'' ``In addition to nesting subactions inside other actions, it is sometimes useful to start a new top action inside another action. Such a `nested' top action, unlike a subaction, has no special privileges relative to its parent; for example, it is not able to read an atomic object modified by its parent. Furthermore, the commit of a nested top action is not relative to its parent; its versions are written to stable storage, and its locks are released, just as for normal top actions. Nested top actions are useful for benevolent side effects.''},

  ABSTRACT = {We present an elegant deterministic load balancing strategy for distribution sort that is applicable to a wide variety of parallel disks and parallel memory hierarchies with both single and parallel processors. The simplest application of the strategy is an optimal deterministic algorithm for external sorting with multiple disks and parallel processors. In each input/output (I/O) operation, each of the $D \geq 1$ disks can simultaneously transfer a block of $B$ contiguous records. Our two measures of performance are the number of I/Os and the amount of work done by the CPU(s); our algorithm is simultaneously optimal for both measures. We also show how to sort deterministically in parallel memory hierarchies. When the processors are interconnected by any sort of a PRAM, our algorithms are optimal for all parallel memory hierarchies; when the interconnection network is a hypercube, our algorithms are either optimal or best-known.},

@REPORT{PalacharlaJoSm96,
  ABSTRACT = {To characterize future performance limitations of superscalar processors, the delays of key pipeline structures in superscalar processors are studied. First, a generic superscalar pipeline is defined. Then the specific areas of register renaming, instruction window wakeup and selection logic, and operand bypassing are analyzed. Each is modeled and Spice simulated for feature sizes of 0.8um, 0.35um, and 0.18um. Performance (delay) results and trends are expressed in terms of issue width and window size. This analysis indicates that window (wakeup and select) logic and operand bypass logic are likely to be the most critical in the future.},

  ANNOTATION = {(Bradley Thursday, October 3 2002): The idea of this invention is that each memory module has a scratch buffer cache. The processor can write several items to the buffer, and the tell the memory module to commit them. To commit, the memory module takes the items from the buffer and writes them to the memory. To abort, the memory module takes the old values from the buffer and writs them to memory. Even if the processor fails in the middle, the memory will be consistent. Some differences from our work: It is not clear how to make transactions that involve memory locations in two different memory modules. Also, it is not clear how to make transactions that are too big to fit in the scratch buffer.},

  ABSTRACT = {On-line algorithms service sequences of requests, one at a time, without knowing future requests. We compare their performance with the performance of algorithms that generate the sequences and service them as well. In many settings, on-line algorithms perform almost as well as optimal off-line algorithms, by using statistics about previous requests in the sequences. Since remembering such information may be expensive, we consider the use of randomization to eliminate memory. In the process, we devise and study performance measures for randomized on-line algorithms. We develop and analyze memoryless randomized on-line algorithms for the cacheing problem and its generalizations.},

  ABSTRACT = {A simple algorithm is presented for emulating an N-processor concurrent-read-concurrent-write parallel random access machine (PRAM) on an N-node butterfly. Each step of the PRAM is emulated in time O(log N) with high probability, using first-in-first-out queues of size O(1) at each node. The only use of randomization is in selecting a hash function to distribute the shared address space of the PRAM onto the nodes of the butterfly. The routing itself is both deterministic and oblivious, and messages are combined without the use of associative memories or explicit sorting. Besides being optimal, the algorithm has the advantage of extreme simplicity and is easy to use in practice.},

  ABSTRACT = {Problems whose data are too large to fit into main memory are called {\it out-of-core} problems. Out-of-core parallel-I/O algorithms can handle much larger problems than in-memory variants and have much better performance than single-device variants. However, they are not commonly used---partly because the understanding of them is not widespread. Yet such algorithms ought to be growing in importance because they address the needs of users with ever-growing problem sizes and ever-increasing performance needs. \par This paper addresses this lack of understanding by presenting an introduction to the data-transfer models on which most of the out-of-core parallel-I/O algorithms are based, with particular emphasis on the Parallel Disk Model. Sample algorithms are discussed to demonstrate the paradigms (algorithmic techniques) used with these models. \par Our aim is to provide insight into both the paradigms and the particular algorithms described, thereby also providing a background for understanding a range of related solutions. It is hoped that this background would enable the appropriate selection of existing algorithms and the development of new ones for current and future out-of-core problems.},

  ABSTRACT = {We provide the first optimal algorithms in terms of the number of input/outputs (I/Os) required between internal memory and multiple secondary storage devices for the problems of sorting, FFT, matrix transposition, standard matrix multiplication, and related problems. Our two-level memory model is new and gives a realistic treatment of {\em parallel block transfer}, in which during a single~I/O each of the $P$ secondary storage devices can simultaneously transfer a contiguous block of $B$ records. The model pertains to a large-scale uniprocessor system or parallel multiprocessor system with $P$ disks. In addition, the sorting, FFT, permutation network, and standard matrix multiplication algorithms are typically optimal in terms of the amount of internal processing time. The difficulty in developing optimal algorithms is to cope with the partitioning of memory into $P$~separate physical devices. Our algorithms' performance can be significantly better than those obtained by the well-known but nonoptimal technique of disk striping. Our optimal sorting algorithm is randomized, but practical; the probability of using more than $\ell$ times the optimal number of I/Os is exponentially small in $\ell (\log \ell) \log (M/B)$, where $M$ is the internal memory size.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we introduce parallel versions of two hierarchical memory models and give optimal algorithms in these models for sorting, FFT, and matrix multiplication. In our parallel models, there are $P$ memory hierarchies operating simultaneously; communication among the hierarchies takes place at a base memory level. Our optimal sorting algorithm is randomized and is based upon the probabilistic partitioning technique developed in the companion paper for optimal disk sorting in a two-level memory with parallel block transfer. The probability of using $\ell$ times the optimal running time is exponentially small in~$\ell (\log \ell) \log P$.},

  SUMMARY = {More Argus. ``A major issue in many applications is how to preserve the consistency of data in the presence of concurrency and hardware failures. We suggest addressing this problem by implementing applications in terms of abstract data types with two properties: Their objects are atomic (they provide serializa- bility and recoverability for activities using them) and resilient (they survive hardware failures with acceptably high probability). We define what it means for abstract data types to be atomic and resilient. We also discuss issues that arise in implementing such types, and describe a particular linguistic mechanism provided in the Argus programming language.''},

  ABSTRACT = {The amount of sequence information in public repositories is growing at a rapid rate. Although these data are likely to contain clinically important information that has not yet been uncovered, our ability to effectively mine these repositories is limited. Here we introduce Sequence Bloom Trees (SBTs), a method for querying thousands of short-read sequencing experiments by sequence, 162 times faster than existing approaches. The approach searches large data archives for all experiments that involve a given sequence. We use SBTs to search 2,652 human blood, breast and brain RNA-seq experiments for all 214,293 known transcripts in under 4 days using less than 239 MB of RAM and a single CPU. Searching sequence archives at this scale and in this time frame is currently not possible using existing tools.},
